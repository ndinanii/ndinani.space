## My Strong Recommendation: Netlify

### Why Netlify is perfect for your Salesforce portfolio:

1. **Professional Presentation**
   - Recruiters see modern deployment
   - Shows you know current tools
   - Clean, shareable URLs

2. **Interview Talking Point**
   - "I use Netlify for CI/CD"
   - "Deploy previews for testing"
   - "Demonstrates DevOps knowledge"

3. **Future Growth**
   - Add contact form easily
   - Serverless functions for demos
   - A/B test different versions

4. **Salesforce Connection**
   - Like Heroku (owned by Salesforce)
   - Similar workflow to Salesforce DX
   - Shows platform thinking

5. **Time Savings**
   - 5-minute setup vs 15-minute
   - Better debugging when issues arise
   - Instant rollbacks if needed

## When GitHub Pages Makes Sense

Use GitHub Pages if:
- ❌ You already have many GH Pages sites
- ❌ You want everything in GitHub
- ❌ You're building open-source documentation
- ❌ You never need preview deployments
- ❌ Portfolio will rarely change

For a **professional Salesforce portfolio** that you'll **update regularly** and **share with recruiters**, these don't apply.
