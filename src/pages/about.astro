                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900">My Core Philosophy</h2>
                <p class="text-lg">
                    I am a Salesforce Platform Developer specializing in translating complex business challenges into scalable, human-centered technical solutions. I don't just build; I architect high-ROI platform assets by maximizing the power of declarative tools like Flow and embedding AI agents directly into the Sales and Service Clouds.
                    My goal is always to reduce technical debt, automate high-volume tasks, and accelerate crucial business processes.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900">The Law & Logic Foundation</h2>
                <p class="text-lg">
                    My path to technology was non-traditional, beginning with legal studies. That foundation gave me a rigorous training in:
                </p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-lg space-y-2">
                    <li><strong>Structured Thinking:</strong> Analyzing complex problems from first principles.</li>
                    <li><strong>Clear Documentation:</strong> Translating complex concepts into easily understood language for stakeholders.</li>
                    <li><strong>Persuasive Argumentation:</strong> Defining testable criteria and validating requirements.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900">From Music to Code: The "Clicks-as-Code" Realization</h2>
                <p class="text-lg">
                    I discovered my alignment in tech by recognizing a parallel between music production and programming. High-level creative tools—like a digital audio workstation—are essentially a user-friendly interface to control complex underlying logic.
                    This intuitive understanding of "clicks-as-code" is why I excel on the Salesforce platform. I view the App Builder and Flow not just as tools, but as a strategic advantage to deliver powerful solutions efficiently.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900">Proof in the Platform</h2>
                <p class="text-lg">
                    Through intensive, project-based training simulating full-stack development and business analysis, I've proven my ability to move from strategy to execution. My experience includes:
                </p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-lg space-y-2">
                    <li><strong>Automation:</strong> Writing robust Apex (with 75%+ code coverage) for bulk processing and implementing a "Flow-first" strategy for an end-to-end logistics solution.</li>
                    <li><strong>AI Implementation:</strong> Architecting an AI-powered service strategy using Einstein Bots and AI Case Classification to manage daily case influx, intelligently route priority issues, and automate routine requests.</li>
                    <li><strong>UX & Data Integrity:</strong> Engineering secure Lead-to-Opportunity flows to guarantee 100% unique lead records and building unified Sales Dashboards using LWC to streamline agent workflows.</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="text-lg">
                    I am a versatile, resilient, and adaptable communicator, eager to deliver the next generation of AI-enabled solutions for a leading implementation partner.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900">Next Steps?</h2>
                <p class="text-lg">
